Psensor - Temperature Monitoring For Linux
------------------------------------------

Psensor is a graphical temperature monitor for Linux.

It can monitor:

 * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using
   lm-sensors).
 * the temperature of the NVidia GPUs (using XNVCtrl).
 * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp).
 * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm-sensors).
 * the temperature of a remote computer.
 * the cpu load.

Alarms using Desktop Notification can be set to each sensor to notify
high temperatures.

For Ubuntu users, Psensor is providing an Application Indicator to
alert users when a temperature is too high.

To monitor the temperature of a remote computer:

 * start psensor-server on the remote computer. The default port is
   3131 and can be changed by using the '--port=PORT' command line
   option.

 * start psensor with the '--url' option: psensor
  --url=http://hostname:3131

WARNING: 
psensor-server does not provide any way to restrict the connection to
the HTTP server, worst, no effort has been made against malicious HTTP
attacks.  You should make the psensor-server port available only to a
network or computer you trust by using the usual network security
tools of the system (for example, iptables).

  
Installation
------------

Psensor can be compiled and installed on any modern linux
distribution.

Debian
------

For Debian, the binary and source packages are available in the wheezy
(testing) and sid (unstable) repositories.

Debian package information are available at:
http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/psensor.html

Compilation requires the following packages:

gettext libgtk-3-dev libgconf2-dev libnotify-dev libsensors4-dev
help2man libcurl4-openssl-dev libjson0-dev libmicrohttpd-dev
libgtop2-dev

Ubuntu
------

Notes about installation on Ubuntu is available at:
http://wpitchoune.net/blog/psensor/ubuntu-integration

Since Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10), psensor is available in the universe
repository of Ubuntu.

For other Ubuntu releases, the easy way to install Psensor and
Psensor-server is to use the dedicated PPA.

For the last stable version:
sudo apt-get apt-add-repository ppa:/jfi/psensor
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install psensor

For the last development version:
sudo apt-get apt-add-repository ppa:/jfi/psensor-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install psensor
sudo apt-get install psensor-server

Alternatively, you can download Ubuntu binary packages from:
http://wpitchoune.net/psensor/files/ubuntu/
The manual installation of the psensor and psensor-server packages
requires also the installation of psensor-common which contains
the multiple languages support.

Centos 6
--------

psensor can be compiled on Centos 6.0, by installing the following
packages:
gcc gtk2-devel GConf2-devel help2man gettext-devel libnotify-deval
lm_sensors-devel libgtop2-devel

As microhttpd and json-c libraries are not available in the standard centos
repository, psensor-server cannot be compiled and the remote
monitoring feature of psensor will not be available.

Installation from source archive
--------------------------------

Psensor compilation requires:

 * make/gcc	
 * lm-sensors
 * library sensors4
 * library gtk2 (>= 2.18)

 * library libnotify (optional)
 * library libappindicator (optional)
 * library libXNVCtrl (optional)
 * library json0 and curl (optional, required for remote monitoring)
 * library unity (>=v3.4.2, optional)
 * library gtop2 (optional, required for CPU usage)

Psensor-server compilation requires:
 * make/gcc	
 * lm-sensors
 * library sensors4
 * help2man 
 * library libmicrohttpd
